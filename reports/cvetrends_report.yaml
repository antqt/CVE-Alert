- A vulnerability in the installer component of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client
  for Windows could allow an authenticated local attacker to copy user-supplied files
  to system level directories with system level privileges. The vulnerability is due
  to the incorrect handling of directory paths. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
  by creating a malicious file and copying the file to a system directory. An exploit
  could allow the attacker to copy malicious files to arbitrary locations with system
  level privileges. This could include DLL pre-loading, DLL hijacking, and other related
  attacks. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs valid credentials on
  the Windows system.

CVE-2020-3433:
- ''
- A vulnerability in the interprocess communication (IPC) channel of Cisco AnyConnect
  Secure Mobility Client for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker
  to perform a DLL hijacking attack. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would
  need to have valid credentials on the Windows system. The vulnerability is due to
  insufficient validation of resources that are loaded by the application at run time.
  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPC message to
  the AnyConnect process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute
  arbitrary code on the affected machine with SYSTEM privileges. To exploit this vulnerability,
  the attacker would need to have valid credentials on the Windows system.
